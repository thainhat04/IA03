# Login and Logout Feature Implementation

## ‚úÖ What Was Added

### 1. Authentication Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Created `AuthContext` for managing authentication state
- Stores JWT token and user email in localStorage
- Provides `login()`, `logout()`, and `isAuthenticated` state
- Persists authentication across page refreshes

### 2. Updated Services (`src/services/userService.ts`)
- Added `loginUser()` function to call `/user/login` endpoint
- Returns JWT token from backend
- Includes TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 3. Updated Login Page (`src/pages/Login.tsx`)
- Connected to real backend API (removed mock)
- Uses React Query mutation for API calls
- Shows loading state during login
- Displays error messages on failure
- Redirects to home page on successful login
- Stores token and user email in context

### 4. Updated Home Page (`src/pages/Home.tsx`)
- Shows different UI when user is authenticated
- Displays logged-in user's email
- Shows "Log Out" button when logged in
- Shows "Sign Up" and "Log In" buttons when not logged in

### 5. Updated App Component (`src/App.tsx`)
- Wrapped routes with `AuthProvider` for global auth state

### 6. Updated Backend DTO (`backend/src/user/dto/register-user.dto.ts`)
- Removed strict password validation from `LoginUserDto`
- Allows login with existing user passwords

## üéØ Features

### Login Flow
1. User enters email and password
2. Frontend calls `POST /user/login`
3. Backend validates credentials and returns JWT token
4. Frontend stores token and email in localStorage
5. User is redirected to home page
6. Home page shows logged-in state with logout option

### Logout Flow
1. User clicks "Log Out" button
2. Token and email removed from localStorage
3. User redirected to non-authenticated home view

### State Persistence
- Authentication state persists across page refreshes
- If user has valid token in localStorage, they stay logged in
- No need to login again on every page visit

## üîê Security

- JWT tokens stored securely in localStorage
- Passwords are hashed on backend (bcrypt)
- Token expires after 1 hour (configurable)
- Backend validates password on every login

## üì° API Endpoints Used

### POST /user/login
**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

**Response (Error):**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "Invalid email or password"
}
```

## üß™ Testing the Features

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Login
1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Sign Up" and create an account
3. Click "Log In"
4. Enter your email and password
5. You should be redirected to home and see your email
6. Click "Log Out"
7. You should see the login/signup options again

### 4. Test Persistence
1. Log in with your credentials
2. Refresh the page
3. You should still be logged in
4. Close and reopen the browser
5. You should still be logged in

## üé® UI/UX

- Loading states during API calls
- Error messages for failed logins
- Success feedback on successful login
- Seamless transitions between authenticated/unauthenticated states
- Responsive design maintained
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- Add protected routes that redirect to login
- Add token expiration handling
- Add "Remember Me" functionality
- Add password reset feature
- Add profile page
- Add session timeout warning
